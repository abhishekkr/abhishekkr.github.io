As currently, the major concern around DevOps world is 'The Mantra of Automation' at the level of

+ System/Environments Provisioning (easy &amp; fast using Cloud Support)
+ Idempotent Configuration (using Automated Configuration Services)
+ Logging/Analytics (using automated detailed logging and clever analysis)

This presentation just mentions the *security considerations related to all these 3 DevOps processes*.


* Provisioning being affected by insecurities in cloud frameworks, vulnerable service APIs and virtualization breakOuts.

* Configuration Management threatened by non-robust services and non-preferred storage of sensitive configuration data.

* Log Analysis frameworks have been several times attacked by infecting the received logs resulting in service level non-sanitized input attacks.
