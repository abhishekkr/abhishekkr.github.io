This is a part of "Eden Guide to Hacking" which is my writing attempt for a quick to read, broadway guide to HACKING ~ for anyone to have grasp of important concepts and skills which makes up the knowledge base of a hacker.

W.I.P. @[abhishekkr/eden_guide_to_hacking](https://github.com/abhishekkr/eden_guide_to_hacking/) are hacking philosophy from `Rig Veda` and `Sun Tzu's Art of War`. 

### Art of Hacking

#### from 'Rig Veda'

* "Who so would kill us,  whether he be a strange foe or one of us."

> Means: "The security parameters could be defeated by (un/mis)-handled feature or an already compromised component present within an un-breakable system."

* "Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou arrow, sharpened by our Prayer. Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive."
 
> Means: "Make an exploit robust, accurate, infectious and untraceable."

#### Skills could be seen as 13 chapters of Sun Tzu's 'Art of War'

* Laying Plans
> Exploit the parameter never thought to be a part of the security implications of the system.

* Waging War

* The Army on the March

* Situational Positioning
> Access, attack & safety parameters involved.
