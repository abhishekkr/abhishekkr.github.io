## A Life-Time Ban from Google Adsense, Two Times

### First Life, First Ban

> I registered for Google Adsense service on my portal `http://www.alwayspost.cjb.net/` (it's dead now and no more belongs to me, was just a free web hosting solution) in very initial days, probably starting 2004.

I used to have **few newbie blogs** (not these, other newbie blogs) on blogger related to movies, wallpapers & technology.

So, in a very honest way I added the provided AdSense code to my blogs and started posting regularly.
It was working at a sloooow rate but I was Ok with it.

I recently moved over from C++ to play **with VB6** and was *trying all fun stuff* that I could get my hands on.
One of the fun things I found was making mouse-clicks at desired locations.

> There was an *ie-ocx-control* in a *form*, loading all my *blogs* one-by-one and code (pre-loaded with specific locations of X-Y locations of Ads on the pages) forging mouse-left-clicks on all Ads... all repeated with a simple Timer.

Just left it on for a night... had LOADS of Ad Clicks and never tried it again.

One week later, there was a mail from AdSense in my GMail account **stating I've been banned for life-time** from Google's AdSense service.


### 'Second Life' in Google AdSense

I signed-up for a new e-mail address and tried registering with another mailing address of mine, and there it was... a new AdSense account.

This time I did nothing against the rules.

Google released Page Creator (which is closed now) and I registered a new portal on my mailing-address at `http://abhikumar163.googlepages.com` (another homepage set up at Google Pages product that's there no more).
Started linking it on forums with some technological content to get valid page hits.

**And, I made a mistake.**
I placed a link to my older Adsense account associated portal on this new portal.


**Google's Crawler, and then Staff noticed it after I attained some amount in my account.** They blocked my account and banned me for life-time Second time.

*Currently, I'm on my Second Life-time Ban... and don't wanna Third Play, may be when I get bored again.*
