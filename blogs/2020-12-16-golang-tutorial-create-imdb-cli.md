## Create an IMDB cli in Golang (via Web Scraping)

> Let's Code

It's a video coding session to create an IMDB cli using Go language.

This will involve Web Scraping and Terminal usability as

* Making an HTTP Request to *IMDB find URL*.

* Query result elements from fetched HTTP Response.

* Make HTTP Request to IMDB for *result titles' details*.

* Query some key data points from Response, say for Director.

* Show the result on console.
