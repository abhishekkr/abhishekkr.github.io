**is Python installed, you already have Simple HTTP Server**

if you need any simple plain web-server on your machine to server files (html or else)

**and**

if you have PYTHON installed over your machine

**then**

you don't need anything else

**because**

you can run PYTHON itself in Simple HTTP Server mode to serve files from any directory you need

**by**

following below steps
> * Step1. opening shell/command-prompt
>
> * Step2. cd (change dir) to directory you want to be root of your server
>
> * Step3. run this command without quotes `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
>
> Finally, say abra-ca-dabra... thanks...

**now**

you have a Simple HTTP Server running, that can be accessed at Port 8000 of your Server's IP/Name


**so**

you can test it by browsing in any web browser at `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000/`
