Weeks back, I saw **Scribd.com offering me to buy/upload something for downloading a Document uploaded on it**. Second time when I opened some document, in another browser **it shows disabled 'download', 'print', and 'mobile' option**.

As I didn't get that Document to download, I didn't felt like reading it online also... **so just thought why not try to download it and if I succeed, then I'll read it online**. And I read it online :)

> So, here is a bug (which  has now been fixed) in Scribd.com... that allowed users to get a local copy of documents which were devoid of download and print options.

**It's how layered limitation can be broken, and why restrictions must be implemented root-level-up and not just as user-level module.**

> So, now you can either Print the document or create a PDF/image printing this document using softwares like PDFCreator.
