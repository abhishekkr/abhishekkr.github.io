## Indian Airport Internet ~ Hacking Policies Not Tweaking Systems

Few Indian Airport avail WiFi Internet Connectivity to Customers... and what I'm going to discuss about is **not hacking the WiFi Network but** a simple naive way to hack the **Service Scheme instead** and gain much more free access than provided little i.e. 30min.

I found it in two cities (Delhi, Bengaluru among visited Indian Airports) till now. Both have different hardware supporting it but the same service scheme.

### The Service Acts in following way:

* Step.1:

> You'll get an Open WiFi Network by the name of Airport which lets you to connect without any credentials.
>
> Connect to it.

* Step.2:

> Open web-browser and hit any URL; this will redirect you to a single page provided by Service Provider with details of how you can get credentials for free-demo WiFi-access.
>
> Here, you'll have to submit your Mobile Phone number, which will receive SMS of credentials for demo access.
>
> Get the credentials.

* Step.3:

> Use those credentials on the same page, under login section.
>
> You are connected to WiFi for internet access until demo-time (30 minutes) pass.

### Loopholes in Service Scheme:

* Continuous Access For Longer Duration

> The more mobile numbers you can have access to...
>
> * give your friends/family/personal/official Mobile Numbers to gain more demo credentials...
>
> * and simply ask them to forward respective SMS to you
>
> ...the more duration you can have demo WiFi access.
>
> Now, the system don't check your MAC Address for earlier demo privileged machines...
>
> so you don't even require anything as simple as mac-changer.

* Parallel Access For Same Credential Set

> As, I already said MAC is not checked... so suppose you have multiple WiFi enabled devices.
>
> You can use the same credentials on all devices at the same time.
>
> Just need to consider what is the time-frame for that credential to expire.
