**Most creative non-technical hacker practice known to mankind.**

* It's Art of Communication with People for 'Information Leak'.

* You have a 'Victim' identified by now and wanna collect more and more available information related to them.

* Not just any relevant information, but sensitive details, that Victim or related people handover to you in confidence.

* You think like a con-artist, assess weakness of your victim & the possibilities of make-believe for them.

* Then you come up with an entire scenario to pose yourself a reliable savior for your Victim to be saved; a benefactor.

* And you will find them revealing such discreet and sensitive information so that they can encash the situation to its max.

* And let you gather all sensitive information that you can.


**Example**: `The pretend employee loosing access at critical time`

* You are a management personnel on client location in middle of a very life-changing deal.

* You need to get some files from your organization's machine or file-share; but can't access them due to firewall policies on either side.

* If you can't seal the deal, the failure will take away your job and the person refusing you such crucial-moment help.

* And there are many chances that you'll get the data fetched from your pretended 'Employee', mailed to you.


**Example**: `I'm here to check your Network from Agency`

* You are at home of your Victim when some family member, hopefully not much security aware is in-charge and pose as the Network Guy from the Telecom Agency they use.

* Offering new organization customer satisfaction mumble-jumble, you try to get access to check health status of network devices installed there, and more computing devices if possible.

* Now, if the devices are tweakable without any credential request from the family member there... try that first.

* If it doesn't work and even they don't have access, then pose as attempting the 'Master Password' so they don't inform the Victim.
