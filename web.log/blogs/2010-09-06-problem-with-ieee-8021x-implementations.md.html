<p>I was just looking over some gyan for 802.1x implementation on Cisco's Portal.</p>
<p>They have a very nice guide over Phase Deployment Model for Identity Based Network Services.</p>
<p>While learning a bit, I saw mention of fallback option for IEEE 802.1x. Then I checked whether Juniper has it or not and it supports it too.</p>
<p><strong>MAB i.e. MAC Authnetication Bypass</strong> providing support for Legacy Devices (say Printers) which are not capable of IEEE 802.1x and hence require some other method of authentication.</p>
<p>And the method provided to them is adding the incapable device's MAC Address to a static (or even dynamic based on implementation) MAC list on 802.1x provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There goes the cocroach surviving Nuclear Attack. The super-strong 802.1x bypassed by a MAC ...are they really having faith on this, or have it implemented in super-man style. Though currently I can't think of any super-man for MAC Authentication. All I see is Sipper-Man :( sipping my security away.</p>
<p>Attacker just have to DUPLICATE allowed MAC, and enjoy the falling security.</p>
<p>Seriously, I'm afraid... if anyone know the manner of its implementation hidden to me till now, which makes it secure. Please, let me know asap.</p>
<p>If you want their support to make your environment vulnerable: <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_user_services/configuration/guide/standalone_mab.html">Cisco Support</a></p>
