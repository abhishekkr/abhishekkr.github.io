<p><em>SOLR</em>... what it is?</p>
<p>link: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/FAQ#What_is_Solr.3F" class="uri">http://wiki.apache.org/solr/FAQ#What_is_Solr.3F</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>in short... it's an enterprise class search server</p>

<p>SOLR Security Consideration... are clearly stated at link: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrSecurity" class="uri">http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrSecurity</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solr does not concern itself with security either at the document level or the communication level.</p></li>
<li><p>It strongly recommends that the application server containing Solr be firewalled such that the only clients with access to Solr are your own</p></li>
<li><p>Default installation of Solr allows any client with access to it to add, update, and delete documents (and of course search/read too), including access to the Solr configuration and schema files and the administrative user interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if firewalled, it might be vulnerable to CSRF because Solr's basic behavior is to receive updates and deletes via HTTP...</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you restricted Solr's /update handler to accept connections from approved hosts/clients...</p>
<p>then also approved clients can be tricked to open another page with malicious script while they are authenticated at Solr.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic technique to mitigate this risk is to configure Servlet Container to server speicifc IPs or with HTTP-Authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Solr doesn't aim to for Document Level Security, recommended way is through Apache Lucene Connector Framework.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>SOLR is a very capable search server, but if you need to use it... be sure to make it unreachable.</p>
