<h3 id="awkill-all-instances">aw(Kill) all instances:</h3>
<p>It has been happening in Linux where sometimes I need to start/restart/stop any Linux service but either it don't have a <code>(init.d,rc.d,*)/</code>Service Script or simply failed even if it had then the usual thing I used to do is get Process ID of relevant App by using</p>
<pre><code>ps aux | grep $StuckApp</code></pre>
<p>and then kill it by</p>
<pre><code>kill -9 $PID</code></pre>
<p>But few days back I ran a server (w/o any service script), generating 7-10 parallel instances of it.</p>
<p>Now to kill it look + type all PIDs... now 'm not lazy but that real wastage of time.</p>
<p>So I automated it with help of AWK.</p>
<h4 id="so-here-is-a-commandscript-you-can-use-to-automate-it-in-similar-cases">So here is a command/script you can use to automate it in similar cases:</h4>
<ul>
<li>shell command:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ps aux | grep $StuckAppNameHere | awk &#39;{print $2; system(&quot;kill -9 &quot;$2&quot;&quot;);}&#39;;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>to use it as a shell script save following two lines in a script:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>echo &quot;Killing all instances found matching for &quot;$1
ps aux | grep $1 | awk &#39;{print $2; system(&quot;kill -9 &quot;$2&quot;&quot;);}&#39;</code></pre>
<p>And pass the name of app to be matched and killed as parameter to it, say you saved <code>script as 'awKillAll.sh'</code>, and you have to kill all <code>processes matching with 'python'</code>.</p>
<p>Then use.</p>
<pre><code>awKillAll.sh python</code></pre>
