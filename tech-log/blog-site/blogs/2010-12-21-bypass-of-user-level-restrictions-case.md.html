<p>Weeks back, I saw <strong>Scribd.com offering me to buy/upload something for downloading a Document uploaded on it</strong>. Second time when I opened some document, in another browser <strong>it shows disabled 'download', 'print', and 'mobile' option</strong>.</p>
<p>As I didn't get that Document to download, I didn't felt like reading it online also... <strong>so just thought why not try to download it and if I succeed, then I'll read it online</strong>. And I read it online :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, here is a bug (which has now been fixed) in Scribd.com... that allowed users to get a local copy of documents which were devoid of download and print options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It's how layered limitation can be broken, and why restrictions must be implemented root-level-up and not just as user-level module.</strong></p>

<p>So, now you can either Print the document or create a PDF/image printing this document using softwares like PDFCreator.</p>
