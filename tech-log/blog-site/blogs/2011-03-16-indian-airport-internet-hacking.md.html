<p>Few Indian Airport avail WiFi Internet Connectivity to Customers... and what I'm going to discuss about is <strong>not hacking the WiFi Network but</strong> a simple naive way to hack the <strong>Service Scheme instead</strong> and gain much more free access than provided little i.e. 30min.</p>
<p>I found it in two cities (Delhi, Bengaluru among visited Indian Airports) till now. Both have different hardware supporting it but the same service scheme.</p>

<h3 id="the-service-acts-in-following-way">The Service Acts in following way:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Step.1:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You'll get an Open WiFi Network by the name of Airport which lets you to connect without any credentials.</p>
<p>Connect to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Step.2:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Open web-browser and hit any URL; this will redirect you to a single page provided by Service Provider with details of how you can get credentials for free-demo WiFi-access.</p>
<p>Here, you'll have to submit your Mobile Phone number, which will receive SMS of credentials for demo access.</p>
<p>Get the credentials.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Step.3:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Use those credentials on the same page, under login section.</p>
<p>You are connected to WiFi for internet access until demo-time (30 minutes) pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="loopholes-in-service-scheme">Loopholes in Service Scheme:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Access For Longer Duration</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The more mobile numbers you can have access to...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>give your friends/family/personal/official Mobile Numbers to gain more demo credentials...</p></li>
<li><p>and simply ask them to forward respective SMS to you</p></li>
</ul>
<p>...the more duration you can have demo WiFi access.</p>
<p>Now, the system don't check your MAC Address for earlier demo privileged machines...</p>
<p>so you don't even require anything as simple as mac-changer.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Parallel Access For Same Credential Set</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As, I already said MAC is not checked... so suppose you have multiple WiFi enabled devices.</p>
<p>You can use the same credentials on all devices at the same time.</p>
<p>Just need to consider what is the time-frame for that credential to expire.</p>
