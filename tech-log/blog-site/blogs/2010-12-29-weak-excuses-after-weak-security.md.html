<p>Now, this year has been filled with loads of news related to user-data getting leaked from different websites... but it wasn't much disturbing as web-vulnerabilities in Facebook are well known and accepted as cons of the deal and neither 1.3m a/c details leaked from Gawker came as a shock (it was more of a Tweet-Flood)</p>
<p><strong>But</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Dec-17-2010, Mozilla was reported about availability of its user-accounts (partially, which were used on addons.mozilla.org) over a public server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have projects like Firefox (super famous web-browser), NSS (one of the most famous libraries for developing secured client-server application), and more... if an organization like them do a mistake like this, oh yeah... hackers paradise.</p>
<h3 id="its-how-they-defend-themselves...">It's how they defend themselves...</h3>
<ul>
<li>database included 44,000 inactive accounts using older</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>but don't you think... even inactive users on a site deserve their privacy, and if they were inactive and not important then better purge the information pertaining to account... why keep it instead</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>md5-based password hashes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>they don't use it now... for active users they support SHA-512 per-user-salt mechanism; now that's good</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>current addons.mozilla.org users and accounts are not at risk</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>so if I don't use Mozilla anymore... they wouldn't respect my a/c details anymore and still keep it... so that in future they could 'arrrrgh sorrry' me, brutally nice</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>incident did not impact any of Mozillaâ€™s infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>it was available on a public server and not a hacked-n-fetched... bravo</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>only outsider who accessed the data was the security researcher that reported the mistake to Mozilla</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>how are they so sure... if none else reported it doesn't mean that none else saw it, and it is not necessary that everyone accessing it will 'remain in' logs.</p>
