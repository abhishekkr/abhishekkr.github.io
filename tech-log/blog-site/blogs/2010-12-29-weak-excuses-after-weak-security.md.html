<p>now this year has been filled with loads of news related to user-data getting leaked from different websites... but it wasn't much disturbing as web-vulnerabilities in Facebook are well known and accepted as cons of the deal and neither 1.3m a/c details leaked from Gawker came as a shock (it was more of a Tweet-Flood)</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">but </span></p>
<p><b>On </b> <b> <span style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Dec-17-2010 </span>, Mozilla was reported about availability of its user-accounts ( <span style="font-size: x-small;"> <i>partially, which were used on addons.mozilla.org </i> </span>) over a public server. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">They have projects like Firefox (super famous web-browser), NSS (one of the most famous libraries for developing secured client-server application), and more... if an organization like them do a mistake like this, oh yeah... hackers paradise </span></p>
<p><b>it's how they defend themselves... </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>database included 44,000 inactive accounts using older</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"> <b> <i>but don't you think... </i> </b> <i> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">even inactive users on a site deserve their privacy, and if they were inactive and not important then better purge the information pertaining to account... why keep it instead </span> </i> </span>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>md5-based password hashes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <b> <i>they don't use it now... </i> </b> <span style="font-size: small;"> <i style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">for active users they support SHA-512 per-user-salt mechanism; now that's good </i> </span> <b> <i></p>
</i> </b> </span>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
current addons.mozilla.org users and accounts are not at risk
<blockquote>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"> <b> <i>so if I don't use Mozilla anymore... </i> </b> <i> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">they wouldn't respect my a/c details anymore and still keep it... so that in future they could 'arrrrgh sorrry' me, brutally nice </span> </i> </span>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
incident did not impact any of Mozillaâ€™s infrastructure
<blockquote>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"> <b> <i>it was available on a public server and not a hacked-n-fetched... </i> </b> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;"> <i>bravo </i> </span> </span>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<span id="intelliTxt">only outsider who accessed the data was the security researcher that reported the mistake to Mozilla </span>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"> <b> <i>how are they so sure... </i> </b> <i> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">if none else reported it doesn't mean that none else saw it, and it is not necessary that everyone accessing it will 'remain in' logs. </span> </i> </span>
