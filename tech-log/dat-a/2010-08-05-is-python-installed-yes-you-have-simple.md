<b>is Python installed, you already have Simple HTTP Server
</b>

if you need any simple plain web-server on your machine to server files (html or else)

<b>and
</b>
if you have PYTHON installed over your machine

<b>then
</b>
you don't need anything else

<b>because
</b>
you can run PYTHON itself in Simple HTTP Server mode to serve files from any directory you need

<b>by
</b>
following below steps
Step#1.
[ opening shell/command-prompt ]
Step#2.
[ $&gt;cd (change dir) to directory you want to be root of your server ]
Step#3.
[ run this command without quotes
<b>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">"python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
</span>
</b> ]
Finally, [ Say abra-ca-dabra... ] Thanks...

<b>now
</b>
you have a Simple HTTP Server running, that can be accessed at Port 8000 of your Server's IP/Name

<b>so
</b>
you can test it by browsing in any web browser at http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000/
