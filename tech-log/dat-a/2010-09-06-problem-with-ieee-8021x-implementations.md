Then I checked whether Juniper has it or not and it supports it too.<br /><br /><b>MAB i.e. MAC Authnetication Bypass</b> porviding support for Legacy Devices (say Printers) which are not capable of IEEE 802.1x and hence require some other method of authentication.<br />And the method provided to them is adding the incapable device's MAC Address to a static (or even dynamic based on implementation) MAC list on 802.1x provider.<br /><br />There goes the cocroach surviving Nuclear Attack. The super-strong 802.1x bypassed by a MAC ...are they really having faith on this, or have it implemented in super-man style. Though currently I can't think of any super-man for MAC Authentication. All I see is Sipper-Man :( sipping my security away.<br /><br /><b>Attacker just have to DUPLICATE allowed MAC, and enjoy the falling security.</b><i><b><br /><br />Seriously, I'm afraid... if anyone know the manner of its implementation hidden to me till now, which makes it secure. Please, let me know asap. </b></i><br /><br /><i><b>If you want their support to make your environment vulnerable:</b></i><br />Cisco Support: <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_user_services/configuration/guide/standalone_mab.html">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_user_services/configuration/guide/standalone_mab.html</a><br />Juniper Support: <a href="http://kb.juniper.net/KB11429">http://kb.juniper.net/KB11429</a>
